# Making Faces

Before there were emoji, there were [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons){target="_blank"}, whereby text like `:)` was a happy face and text like `:(` was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called `faces.py`, implement a function called `convert` that accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a [slightly smiling face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-smiling-face/)) and any :( converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a [slightly frowning face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-frowning-face/)). All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called `main` that prompts the user for input, calls `convert` on that input, and prints the result. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to input. Be sure to call `main` at the bottom of your file.

??? Tip
    - Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per [input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
    - Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
    - An emoji is actually just a character, so you can quote it like any `str`, a la `"😐"`. And you can copy and paste the emoji from this page into your own code as needed.

## Before You Begin

1. Ensure you are in the root directory of the repository that you cloned to your machine.
2. Change directory to `src/function_variables/` in your terminal window.
```
cd src/function_variables/
```
3. create or open the file `faces.py`
```
code faces.py
```
This is where you’ll write your program.

## How to Test

### Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with python faces.py. Type `Hello :)` and press Enter. Your program should output:
```
Hello 🙂
```
- Run your program with python faces.py. Type `Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output:
```
Goodbye 🙁
```
- Run your program with python faces.py. Type `Hello :) Goodbye :(` and press Enter. Your program should output
```
Hello 🙂 Goodbye 🙁
```

You can execute the below to check your code using `pytest` from the root directory.

```
.\tests\function_variables\test_faces.py
```

A green output from running the test means it was successful. A red output means there is a bug in your code that you need to fix.

## How to Submit

From github desktop or the command line, commit your changes and push them to your repository.

### Codespaces
If you are using codespaces, you can commit your changes directly from the Codespace interface. Click on the Source Control icon in the left sidebar, then click on the "..." button and select "Commit to main". Enter a commit message and click "Commit".

#### Codespace terminal or your local terminal. 

!!! Note
    You will need to have installed `git-scm` for this to work locally

At the `/datatypes $` prompt in your terminal:
```
git add -A 
```
Add all changed files in the repository to be committed
```
git commit -m "your message here"
```
Commit all changes in the REPO with the comment “your message here“ note: If the file is not complete, adjust the comment to describes what is being committed
!!! Note
    Remember to replace "your message here" with a meaningful commit message that describes your changes.

```
git push 
```
Push all changes to the repo.
