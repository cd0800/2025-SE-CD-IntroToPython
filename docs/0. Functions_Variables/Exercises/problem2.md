# Playback Speed

Some people have a habit of ~~lecturing~~ speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with `...` (i.e., three periods).

## Hints
??? Tip
    - Recall that input returns a str, per [input](http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
    - Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [string-methods](http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

## Before You Begin

1. Ensure you are in the root directory of the repository that you cloned to your machine.
2. Change directory to `src/function_variables/` in your terminal window.
```
cd src/function_variables/
```
3. create or open the file `playback.py`
```
code indoor.py
```
This is where you’ll write your program.

## How to Test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `This is Killarney Heights!` and press ++enter++. Your program should output:
```
    This...is...Killarney...Heights! 
```

- Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `This is our week on functions` and press ++enter++. Your program should output:
```
    This...is...our...week...on...functions
```
- Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `Let's implement a function called hello` and press ++enter++. Your program should output
```
    Let's...implement...a...function...called...hello
```

You can execute the below to check your code using `pytest` from the root directory.

```
.\tests\function_variables\test_playback.py
```

A green output from running the test means it was successful. A red output means there is a bug in your code that you need to fix.

## How to Submit

From github desktop or the command line, commit your changes and push them to your repository.

### Codespaces
If you are using codespaces, you can commit your changes directly from the Codespace interface. Click on the Source Control icon in the left sidebar, then click on the "..." button and select "Commit to main". Enter a commit message and click "Commit".

#### Codespace terminal or your local terminal. 

!!! Note
    You will need to have installed `git-scm` for this to work locally

At the `/datatypes $` prompt in your terminal:
```
git add -A 
```
Add all changed files in the repository to be committed
```
git commit -m "your message here"
```
Commit all changes in the REPO with the comment “your message here“ note: If the file is not complete, adjust the comment to describes what is being committed
!!! Note
    Remember to replace "your message here" with a meaningful commit message that describes your changes.

```
git push 
```
Push all changes to the repo.
